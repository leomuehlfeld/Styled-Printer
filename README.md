Simple NodeJS Scripts to print beautiful layouts on your Adafruit/Sparkfun Thermalprinter.

## Features
üé® **Custom Layouts** ‚Äì Bypass Layout Limits

‚ö°Ô∏è **React** ‚Äì Send from react-app with Live-Chat  

üêò **Postgres** ‚Äì Connect to Database to Archive

## Motivation
The idea was simple: People should be able to send a message to a remote thermal printer hooked up to a raspberrypi. Since the built in layout capabilities of the thermal printer and its library are really limited, I wanted to enable things like custom Fonts, proper typography, svgs and more. The Input should be located on a react-app with a live chat displaying all sent messages, while the server should archive sent messages in a database.

## How to run!
This Repository is set up as a mono-repo containing the frontend, server and printer sources in three different folders.

### Server
```bash
$ cd server
$ yarn install
```
In order to archive all printed messages, the project is currently set to connect to a postgres database. I reccomend doing it locally for devleopment and playarround but you can also connect to a production database. You can change the settings for your development and production database in server/knexfile.js. Edit your schema in server/migrations/schmema. For detailed documentation visit [Knex.](http://knexjs.org) Spin up a Database and run
```bash
$ knex migrate:latest
```
_If you need to know how to get a local database up and running, visit [DockerHub‚ÄìPostgres.](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)_

Super! Everything is set, lets start the Server by running
```bash
$ yarn start
```

### Frontend
Set your Server-IP in frontend/src/app.js:32
```javascript
const s = io("000.000.0.00:8080");
```
```bash
$ cd frontend
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

### Printer
Install node and npm on your RaspberryPi. Go to your raspi-config and enable "Serial" under the Networking Options.
```bash
$ sudo raspi-config
```
Copy the "printer" folder to your RaspberryPi. And set your Server-IP in printer/print.js:9
```javascript
const s = io("000.000.0.00:8080");
```
```bash
$ cd printer
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Customize
If you want to edit the layout generated by the RaspberryPi, edit the file index.html located in printer/gen/. You'll find css, js and html in one file.
