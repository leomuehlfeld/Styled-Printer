## Features
üé® **Custom Layouts** ‚Äì Bypass Layout Limits

‚ö°Ô∏è **React** ‚Äì Send from React-Frontend with Live-Chat  

üêò **Postgres** ‚Äì Connect to Database to Archive

## Motivation
The idea was simple: People should be able to send a message to a remote thermal printer hooked up to a raspberrypi.Since the built in layout capabilities of the thermal printer and its library are really limited, I wanted to enable things like custom Fonts, proper typography and more. The Input should be located on a react-webapp with a live chat displaying all sent messages.

<!-- ## How does it work?
I achieved this by equipping the Pi with headless-chrome. The received data renders into an appealing, fully customizeable, layout which gets printed out. Client (ReactApp), Server (NodeJS App) and RaspberryPi (NodeJS App) are talking to each other over a websocket while the server receives, emmits and stores the messages in an optional postgres database. -->

## How to run!
This Repository is set up as a mono-repo containing the frontend, server and printer sources in three different folders.

### Server
```bash
yarn Install
```
In order to archive all printed messages, the project is currently set to connect to a postgres database. I reccomend doing it locally for devleopment and playarround but you can also connect to a production database. You can change the settings for your development and production database in server/knexfile.js. Edit your Schema in server/migrations/schmema. For detailed documentation visit [Knex.](http://knexjs.org). Spin up a Database and run
```bash
knex migrate:latest
```
_If you need to know how to get a local database up and running, visit [DockerHub‚ÄìPostgres.](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)_

Super! Everything is set, lets start the Server by running
```bash
$ yarn start
```

### Frontend
```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

### Printer
Install node and npm on your RaspberryPi. Go to your raspi-config and enable "Serial" under the Networking Options.
```bash
$ sudo raspi-config
```
Copy the "printer" folder to your RaspberryPi.
```bash
$ cd printer
$ npm install
$ node print.js
```

## Customize
If you want to edit the layout generated by the RaspberryPi, edit the file index.html located in printer/gen/.
